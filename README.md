# ICS-Gen

**Instantly convert your travel plans from text or images into calendar events.**

ICS-Gen is a smart, intuitive web application that parses travel itineraries—whether pasted as text or uploaded as an image—and converts them into downloadable `.ics` calendar files. Built with a sleek, modern interface, it leverages AI to intelligently extract event details, saving you the hassle of manual calendar entry.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dual Input Modes:** Paste raw text or upload an image (e.g., a screenshot of a booking confirmation).
- **Intelligent Parsing:** Uses the Gemini AI model to accurately identify event details like summaries, dates, times, locations, and timezones.
- **.ics File Generation:** Creates a universally compatible `.ics` file that can be imported into Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, and other calendar applications.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Installable on both desktop and mobile devices for a native app-like experience and offline access.
- **Secure API Key Storage:** Prompts for your OpenRouter API key on first use and stores it securely in your browser's local storage.
- **Modern, Responsive UI:** A clean, glassmorphism-inspired design that looks great on any device.

## 🚀 How It Works

ICS-Gen streamlines the process of calendar creation into three simple steps:

1.  **Input:** The user provides an itinerary by pasting text or uploading an image.
2.  **Process:** The app sends the input to the Gemini API with a specialized prompt designed to extract event information into a structured JSON format.
3.  **Output:** The extracted events are displayed for review and can be downloaded as a single `.ics` file, ready for import.

The front-end is built with **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and vanilla **JavaScript**, ensuring it is lightweight and fast.
